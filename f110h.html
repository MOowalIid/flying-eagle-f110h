                Sizing Tips:
            </strong>
            These skates are true to size. Zero break-ins are required. If the skates do not come in half sizes or doubt
            your true size, then round your size up.
            Generally, choose the size of your own skates according to the number of sports shoes.

            <b>
                If your instep is relatively high or your feet are relatively wide, it is recommended that you choose a
                larger size of skates

            The Flying Eagle F110H skate is one of the finest 3×110 setups on the market. It is a perfect combination of
            a dual-density F7 Falcon boot, a very comfortable liner, and Supersonic 3×110 frame.The Flying Eagle F7 hard
            boots are the world’s most advanced, combining two plastics of two different densities to allow for perfect
            support and fit. A soft v-cut cuff section as well as a soft lace hole area, designed to keep the skate
            close to your feet and at the same time excellent for jumps and slides thanks to your ankle being supported
            side to side yet free to move in a forward and backward motion. This is also great for long-distance skating
            as it allows you to bend your knees forward more than usual. This skate is extremely durable and versatile,
            built to last and to satisfy even a very demanding and aggressive skater.
            <br>
            The baseplate includes a metal frame attachment plate. This makes the foundation of the skate stable and
            increases the power transfer, making the overall impression of the skate quite fast.

            <br>
            Combine this with an aluminium frame, 110 mm wheels and super fast bearings and you have a very accessible
            skate which is fast, comfortable, supportive and manoeuvrable. Perfect for the seafront, town and city
            skating.
